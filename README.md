# News_Headline_Generator
A Fun little app that uses Natural Language Processing to generate headlines as a Daily Mail reporter.


## TODO:
*  Make a generating language model that can update its counts with new daily headlines
       * Need to write a parser that tokenises the daily mail api responce
       * Need to connect the language model to a database that keeps the count
* Make a front end that makes a request for headline generation and displays it
* Make a backend that updates its language model every day with new headlines
